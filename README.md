1. This idea came into my mind at around May 25. At that time I wanted to get some useful kindergarden enrollment information from internet for my baby. Unfortunately, however, It's so difficult to find useful information. Most of the kindergarden have not a offical web site. And some other web site showing expired information...... So I want to build a web site or a platform, on that we can provide some really helpful, timely information to parents, meanwhile parents, teachers, babies can share some timely, interesting information to each other. Based on the sharing, people will know that where the other kids go to playing, what to eat, which school to learn, what can be referenced......
2. Determine the UI framework at June 4, but I can only imitate a excellent UI that designed by someone else. Why I am not a front-end designer?
3. Start use github at June 5 to manage the sourcecode.
